# Migrations on GTHC

[What is a migration and how do I use it?](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

## When to create a migration
The typical use case of a migration is when you are creating a new model, or adding new elements of data to an already existing table/model. Please remember to run migrations before running the application locally, otherwise, there will be errors.
